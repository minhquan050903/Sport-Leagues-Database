# Sport-Leagues-Database
Database for Sport Leagues 
 I worked with a team of developers to extract critical information from a sports league database using SQL. Our goal was to create a streamlined process for accessing the necessary data quickly and efficiently. To achieve this, we utilized our expertise in SQL to write complex queries that extracted and organized the required data points. This project required strong communication and teamwork skills, as we had to work together to ensure that the queries were optimized for performance and met the project requirements. By successfully completing this project, I gained valuable experience in database management and SQL optimization, as well as improved my collaborative problem-solving skills.
